A single-page résumé template done purely with HTML and CSS,


The resume is purely typeset with HTML and CSS, it's highly customizable 
and you does not require proprietary software. All you need is a text editor and a web browser (see compatibility section below). Oh, maybe some intermediate CSS knowledge. And, since it's open source with Apache License, you're allowed.
HTML and CSS are the beginning of everything that we need to know to make our first web page.

## Table of Content :

- Editor :
     [ Notepad++ ] This is what I typically use. It's open source and has tons of extensions available.
     and you can also choose different editor's as you comfortable
     
-  Web Browser :
    Google Chrome with latest update.
    you can also use Mozilla Firefox , ..etc.
 ## How to run the Web-Application ?
  1. Open your computer 
  2. Write Your HTML/CSS code in editor 
  3. Save the File on local disk
  4. Save the file with (.html) extension i.e. "example.html" 
  5. Open or run the web application with any web-browsers
  6. Now you are able to see the output
  7. Test Your web-api
  8. if any changes you have done in application. save it again
  9. reload the page for see the updated changes.
